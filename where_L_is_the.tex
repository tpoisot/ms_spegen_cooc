where $L$ is the number of lower level species (*e.g.* hosts) found in
the network, and $l_i$ is the number of interaction partners of species
$i$. The vector $\mathbf{s}$ is the distribution of specificities at the
network scale . Values of 1 indicate complete specialism (single partner),
and values of 0 indicate complete generalism (all possible partners).
