# Results

All types of network tend to have more strategy diversity and to be composed
of more specialized species than expected by chance (Table 1). For each
empirical network, we measure whether its structural properties (strategy
diversity, nestedness, modularity) are higher or lower than expected by
chance using the two null models. Our results are reported in Table 1. Both
null models gave consistent results regarding whether the empirical networks
represented a deviation from the random expectations. Host-parasite networks
are on average less modular than expected, herbivory networks are more, and
there is no clear trend in pollination networks. There is a marked tendency
towards higher than expected nestedness in all types of interactions.

Figure 2 presents the distributions of specificity, connectance, nestedness,
and modularity in networks that are either more or less functionally diverse
than expected under the assumptions of null model II (using the outcomes of
model I yields the same qualitative results; see Table 1). Regardless of
the baseline differences between types of network for each of the metrics
considered, higher diversity responded in a consistent way to variation in
the other metrics. Networks with higher average specificity tended to have
lower average strategy diversity, higher connectance, higher nestedness, and
lower modularity (Table 2). There are significant interactions between all of
the variables and the network having higher strategy diversity than expected
by chance, with the exception of modularity (Table 3). These four metrics
alone account for 96% of the variance of strategy diversity, and 63% of the
variance in the deviation of this same metric. All metrics except modularity
had a significant impact on strategy diversity. Interestingly, connectance
was the best predictor of strategy diversity, whereas nestedness was the
best predictor of the extent to which strategy diversity in the empirical
networks deviates from random expectations. This is because by definition,
null model testing removes most of the effects of connectance. The type of
ecological interaction was not significant; detecting possible significance
would have probably required a larger sample size for non-parasitic networks.

We finally examine the relationships between network metrics and strategy
diversity (Fig. 3). Strategy diversity increases with connectance (it is
expected to be 0 for a connectance of 1, but no network in our dataset is
densely connected), decreases with average specificity (as before, strategy
diversity is 0 if mean specificity is 0), increases linearly with nestedness,
and decreases with modularity. An interesting result in this analysis is
that the trend is the same for all three types of interaction considered,
with the exception that herbivory and pollination networks tended to occupy
the "low connectance" end of the gradient; they behave in the same way as do
parasitism networks, reinforcing the idea that structural constraints such
as that introduced by connectance may be driving emergent network properties.
