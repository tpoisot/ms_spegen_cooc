We finally look at the relationships between network metrics and diversity
of strategies (Fig. 3). Strategy diversity increases with connectance (it
is expected to be 0 for a connectance of 1, but no network in our dataset is
densely connected), decreases with average specificity (as before, diversity
of strategy is 0 if the average specificity is 0), increases linearly with
nestedness, and decreases with modularity. An interesting output in this
analysis is that the trend is the same for all three types of interaction
considered. With the exception that herbivory and pollination networks tended
to occupy the "low connectance" end of the gradient, they behave in the same
way as do parasitism networks, reinforcing the idea that structural constraints
such as that introduced by connectance will drive emergent network properties.
