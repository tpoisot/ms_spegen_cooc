We employ three datasets: two for antagonistic (ectoparasite--animal
host and insect herbivore--plant) interactions, and one for mutualistic
(pollinator--plant) interactions. Parasitism networks were collected by
@stanko_mammal_2002 and consist of 121 networks of ectoparasites infecting
rodents in Central Europe, collected in a range of continental ecosystems over
a period of 19 years. Herbivory networks (a total of 23) were collected by
@thebault_stability_2010 from various literature records. Data on mutualistic
interactions are the 29 “plant–pollinators” networks deposited in the
NCEAS InteractionWeb database (`http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/interactionweb/`) as
of May 2012. These data are insect–plant contacts, aggregated from different
sources, spanning a period of over 30 years. Species with no interaction
were removed from the original datasets. Some networks had a connectance
that was too low to allow for efficient or meaningful randomisation
[@poisot_when_2013], and as such were discarded from the analysis. The
final dataset has 115 parasitism networks, 6 herbivory networks, and 12
pollination networks. Because the sample size is unbalanced, we put
particular emphasis on the discussion of parasitism networks.
