$E = 1$ when no two organisms have the same level of specificity, and $E = 0$
when all values of $\mathbf{s}'$ are equal. Note that rounding to the second
decimal place allows accounting for the fact that some organisms may have
very similar (but not exactly equal) specificities. Small differences in
the values of specificity are less important than the potential amplitude of
measurement error, as preliminary tests indicated that the degree to which
values of $\mathbf{s}'$ are rounded does not qualitatively change observed
relationships. It is also known that small differences in link strength have
little to no impact in larger networks [@berlow_interaction_2004].
