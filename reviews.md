Reviewer #1: In this manuscript Poisot et al examine network properties of
175 bipartite species interaction networks. Data is sourced from publically
available datasets and is dominated by plant-insect herbivore interactions.

Although I think this has potential to be a useful contribution I have some
criticisms that I think will improve the manuscript.

1. In general, as a scientist who mostly works on pairwise species
interactions, I was overwhelmed by the network jargon. While overcoming
this was a useful lesson for the reviewer, it involved some considerable
work. I would suggest the authors make sure all network-specific terminology
is clearly defined and its biological significance explained (e.g. species
degree/degree distribution, modularity etc).

> We agree that the terminology of graph theory and its application
to ecology can be overwhelming. We have expanded the "Network analyses"
section of the methods to define what each measure means biologically when
they are introduced.

2. The independence of the different indices is unclear. Do the consistent
patterns observed in figures 1 and 2 represent biological or numerical
phenomena?

> We rewrote part of the discussion to make this point stand out more. In
short, even though there are numerical relationships between all of these
values (which we acknoweldge in the manuscript), the fact that null model
analysis suggests a systematic deviation towards more diversity suggests
the action of ecological mechanisms favoring functional diversity. This
is in line with recent observations in empirical systems. However, because
making this point require to build both on our results and other studies,
we are keeping this part in the discussion and not in the results.

3. The aims of the study are not clearly outlined and articulated

> We have made extensive edits on the introduction to better reflect the
goals of the study. See notably **PP/LL**, and **PP/LL**.

4. The discussion is a bit of a mess. In addition to speclling and grammatical
errors, the arguments developed are not particularly cogent (at least to
me – again here I was overwhelmed by the network jargon) and links to
biology are not very clear. Links to the aims of the study are not clear
but as stated above the aims of the study are not clear either.

> We expect that (i) the better definition of network terminology and (ii)
the changes made to the discussion in response to point 2 above will adress
this comment.

5. Figure 2: legend is not stand-alone; x-axis labels – what are these?

> We have fixed the figure legend.

6. Figure 3: legend is not stand-alone. What are empty triangles?

> We have updated the figure legend.

7. Table 1: Not stand alone. What is NS?

> We have updated the table legend.

8. Table 2. Is this really the clearest way to report your results? i.e
reporting t-values and 95% CIs but no mean difference? The legend is not
stand alone. What are D & S?
