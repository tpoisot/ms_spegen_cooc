Comments to the Author

1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?

The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. 

Reviewer #1: Yes


2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? 

Reviewer #1: Yes


3. Does the manuscript adhere to the PLOS Data Policy?

Authors must follow the PLOS Data policy, which requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction. Please refer to the author’s Data Availability Statement in the manuscript. All data and related metadata must be deposited in an appropriate public repository, unless already provided as part of the submitted article or supporting information. If there are restrictions on the ability of authors to publicly share data—e.g. privacy or use of data from a third party— these reasons must be specified.

Reviewer #1: Yes


4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.

Reviewer #1: No

Reviewer #1: In this manuscript Poisot et al examine network properties of 175 bipartite species interaction networks. Data is sourced from publically available datasets and is dominated by plant-insect herbivore interactions.

Although I think this has potential to be a useful contribution I have some criticisms that I think will improve the manuscript.

1. In general, as a scientist who mostly works on pairwise species interactions, I was overwhelmed by the network jargon. While overcoming this was a useful lesson for the reviewer, it involved some considerable work. I would suggest the authors make sure all network-specific terminology is clearly defined and its biological significance explained (e.g. species degree/degree distribution, modularity etc). 

2. The independence of the different indices is unclear. Do the consistent patterns observed in figures 1 and 2 represent biological or numerical phenomena?

3. The aims of the study are not clearly outlined and articulated

4. The discussion is a bit of a mess. In addition to speclling and grammatical errors, the arguments developed are not particularly cogent (at least to me – again here I was overwhelmed by the network jargon) and links to biology are not very clear. Links to the aims of the study are not clear but as stated above the aims of the study are not clear either. 

5. Figure 2: legend is not stand-alone; x-axis labels – what are these?

6. Figure 3: legend is not stand-alone. What are empty triangles?

7. Table 1: Not stand alone. What is NS?

7. Table 2. Is this really the clearest way to report your results? i.e reporting t-values and 95% CIs but no mean difference? The legend is not stand alone. What are D & S?
