**Figure 2.** Values of average specificity, nestedness, connectance, and
modularity for networks with more (orange) or less (purple) diversity of
strategies than expected by chance. The results within a type of interaction
are all extremely consistent. For this analysis *only*, networks that were
as functionally diverse as expected were removed, as their diversity of
strategies can be explained only by their connectance or degree distribution.
