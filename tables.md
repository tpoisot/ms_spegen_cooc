# Tables

**Table 1.** Results of the null models analyses. For each network metric,
and for each null model, we indicate the proportion of networks that had
significantly larger or smaller values than expected by chance.  A network
has a significantly different value from the prediction when the empirical
value falls outside of the 95% confidence interval for the value as mesured
on randomized networks [@flo11a].

**Table 2.** Analysis of the results presented in Fig. 2. We used a two-sampled
t-test to determine differences from chance expectations for metric networks
with either less, equal, or more strategy diversity. We observe that all
metrics are different from chance expectatons for parasitism networks, but
not for other interaction types (although our failure to report an effect
is most likely due to the small sample size, as attested by some extremely
large confidence intervals).

**Table 3.** Analysis of variance partitioning (ANOVA on linear additive
models) of the effects of connectance, nestedness, mean specificity, and
modularity, on strategy diversity, and the excess diversity of strategy
(deviation of empirical values from simulated networks as asssessed by the
Null Model analysis). Preliminary analyses showed no impact of the interaction
type on these relationships, so this factor was not included as a covariate.
