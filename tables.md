# Tables

**Table 1.** Results of the null models analyses. For each network metric, and
for each null model, we indicate the proportion of networks that had
significantly larger or smaller values of this metric than expected by chance.
A network has a significantly different value from the prediction when the
empirical values falls outside of the 95% confidence interval for the value as
mesured on the randomized networks [see *e.g.* @flores_statistical_2011].

**Table 2.** Analysis of the results presented in Fig. 2. We used a two-sampled
t-test to determine for which metric networks with either, less, as much,
or more strategy diversity than expected by chance differed. We obsere
that all metrics are different for parasitism networks, but not for other
types of interactions (although our failure to report an effect is most
likely due to the small sample size, as attested by some extremely large
confidence intervals).

**Table 3.** Analysis of variance partitioning (ANOVA on a linear additive
models) of the effects of connectance, nestedness, average specificity,
and modularity, on the diversity of strategy, and the excess diversity of
strategy (deviation of empirical values from simulated networks).
Preliminary analyses showed no impact of the type of interactions on these
relationships, so this was not included as a covariate.
