which given that both $E$ and $R$ take values in $[0,1]$, will also return
values in this range. $D = 1$ indicates that the specificity values found
in a network range from highly specialized to highly generalized *and* are
evenly distributed. $D = 0$ means that a network is composed entirely of
species sharing the same specificity values. The two advantages of $D$ are
(i) it accounts both for the range of specificities and their distribution,
and (ii) it is independent of the observed specificity values. We expect
strategy diversity ($D$) to peak at intermediate values of connectance and
specificity, to increase with nestedness, and to decrease with modularity
(Fig.Â 1). The reasoning is as follows. Interaction matrices are physically
constrained objects, in that adding interactions will modify their properties,
and thus produce artifacts [@miklos_randomization_2004;@poisot_when_2013]. By
definition, a perfectly nested network maximizes strategy diversity
[@almeida-neto_consistent_2008], and a modular network tends to minimize
it. A matrix with minimal fill for a given size has all interactions
on the diagonal, and is therefore highly specialized, with no strategy
diversity. Conversely, a completely filled network is extremely generalized,
and thus has no strategy diversity.
