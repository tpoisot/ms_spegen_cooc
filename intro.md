# Introduction

The functional diversity of ecological communities emerges through
the simultaneous occurrence of species with contrasted resource use
[@poisot2011a], habitat selection [@devictor2010], and interactions
[@bascompte2003;@weiner2012]. Both empirical and theoretical studies have shown
how different degrees of niche partitioning can promote functional diversity
[@diaz2001; @petchey2002; @ackerly2007]. However, the co-occurrence of
specialist and generalist species has received considerably less attention. The
majority of studies seeking to understand the conditions for co-occurrence
between populations of specialists and generalists in both biotic (*e.g.*
predator–prey, host–parasite) and abiotic (*e.g.* habitat choice)
interactions have focused on small communities [@wilson1994; @hochberg1990a;
@demeeus1995; @egas2004; @abrams2006; @ravigne2009]. Approaches based
on model analysis or controlled experiments have two features impeding
their generalization to large communities. First, the number of interacting
organisms is often kept low, either to facilitate model analysis or because of
experimental constraints. In practice, this means that studies investigating
the co-occurrence of species with contrasted specificities assume no
intermediate situations between the endpoints of specialism and generalism,
whereas natural systems exhibit more of a continuum [@forister_revisiting_2012;
@poisot_structure_2013]. Second, it is unclear to what extent results can be
scaled up to more realistic communities. @stouffer_understanding_2009 showed
that because adding species and interactions increases the potential for
complex population dynamical feedbacks, complete, realistic networks tend
to exhibit different behaviors than simple modules (*i.e.* those typically
used in models or experiments), begging for an analysis of co-occurrence in
empirical communities.

Network theory offers powerful tools to characterize the complexity of
ecological communities [@proulx_network_2005] and the degree of specialisation
of the species within them [@poisot_mee]. In a species interaction network,
each species is a node, and each interaction is an edge, connecting a
pair of nodes. From a network perspective, measuring the specificity of
a species can be performed by counting the number of links it has with
other species, or to study the distribution of the strengths of such links
[@poisot_comparative_2012]. Previous work described the degree-distribution
of empirical networks, *i.e.* the fact that there is a continuum of species,
ranging from highly specialized to generalists [@otto_allometric_2007]. While
much is known about the factors (*e.g.* biotic [@thrall_coevolution_2007],
abiotic [@ravigne_live_2009; @forister_revisiting_2012], developmental
and physiological [@ferry-graham_using_2002]) driving the specialization
of single species, less is known about the spectrum of specificities and
niche-overlaps that can co-occur in large ecological networks, and reasons
for different spectra. As the co-occurrence and interactions between
specialized and generalized species is key to maintaining functional
diversity [@devictor_defining_2010], promoting community stability
[@hassell_generalist_1986], and ensuring network persistence [@bascompte_2003],
there is a need to investigate the exact extent of this co-occurrence.

In a previous paper [@poisot_conceptual_2011], we argued that the
mechanisms shaping the evolution of specificity were similar for both
antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, which implies that relationships
between specificity, the co- occurrence of specialists and generalists, and
other metrics of community structure should be similar across different
types of ecological interaction, despite each category of network having
different structural properties. One central result of the analyses presented
in the present contribution is that empirical data show consistently more
variation in specificities of all species on the upper trophic level
(hereafter called “strategy diversity”) than predicted by two
contrasting null models. This suggests that organisms with very different
levels of specificity can co-occur in most natural systems.

In this paper, we use a large dataset of species interaction networks spanning
three contrasted types of ecological interactions (herbivory, parasitism,
and mutualism), to characterize to what extent species with different
specificities can co- occur within the same community. Importantly, we find a
continuum from networks of mostly-specialized to mostly-generalized species,
with the potential for specialist/generalist co-occurrence being greater at
intermediate points. Strategy diversity is contingent upon network properties,
including nestedness (a measure of niche overlap between species with different
specificities), modularity (the fact that species interact within loosely
connected clusters), and connectance (the proportion of realized links),
emphasizing the need to adopt a network-oriented methodology in the study
of biotic interactions at the community level.
