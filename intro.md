# Introduction

The functional diversity of ecological communities emerges through
the simultaneous occurrence of species with contrasted resource use
[@poisot2011a], habitat selection [@devictor2010], and interactions
[@bascompte2003;@weiner2012]. Both empirical and theoretical studies have
shown how different degrees of niche partitioning can promote functional
diversity [@diaz2001; @petchey2002; @ackerly2007]. However, the co-occurrence
of specialist and generalist species has received considerably less
attention. The majority of studies seeking to understand the conditions
for co-occurrence between populations of specialists and generalists in
both biotic (*e.g.* predator–prey, host–parasite) and abiotic (*e.g.*
habitat choice) interactions have focused on small communities [@wilson1994;
@hochberg1990a; @demeeus1995; @egas2004; @abrams2006; @ravigne2009]. Approaches
based on model analysis or controlled experiments have two features impeding
their generalization to large communities. First, the number of interacting
organisms is often kept low, either to facilitate model analysis or because of
experimental constraints. In practice, this means that studies investigating
the co-occurrence of species with contrasted specificities assume no intermediate situations between the endpoints of specialism and generalism, whereas natural systems exhibit more of
a continuum [@forister_revisiting_2012; @poisot_structure_2013]. Second,
it is unclear to what extent results can be scaled up to more realistic
communities. @stouffer_understanding_2009 showed that because adding species
and interactions increases the potential for complex population dynamical
feedbacks, complete, realistic networks tend to exhibit different behaviors
than simple modules (*i.e.* those typically used in models or experiments),
begging for an analysis of co-occurrence in empirical communities.

Network theory offers powerful tools to characterize the complexity of
ecological communities [@proulx_network_2005]. In a species interaction
network, each species is a node, and each interaction is an edge, connecting
a pair of nodes. From a network perspective, measuring the specificity
of a species can be performed by counting the number of links it has with
other species, or to study the distribution of the strengths of such links
[@poisot_comparative_2012]. Previous work described the degree-distribution
of empirical networks, *i.e.* the fact that there is a continuum of species,
ranging from highly specialized to generalists [@otto_allometric_2007]. While
much is known about the factors (*e.g.* biotic [@thrall_coevolution_2007],
abiotic [@ravigne_live_2009; @forister_revisiting_2012], developmental and
physiological [@ferry-graham_using_2002]) driving the specialization of single
species, less is known about the spectrum of specificities and niche-overlaps that can co-occur
in large ecological networks, and reasons for different spectra. As the
co-occurrence between specialized and generalized species is key to maintaining
functional diversity [@devictor_defining_2010] or promoting community stability
[@hassell_generalist_1986], there is a need to investigate the maintenance of
species with different specificities.

In a previous paper [@poisot_conceptual_2011], we suggested that the
mechanisms shaping the evolution of specificity were similar for both
antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, which implies that relationships
between specificity, the co- occurrence of specialists and generalists, and
other metrics of community structure should be the same across different
types of ecological interaction, despite each category of network having
different structural properties. One central result of the analyses presented
in the present contribution is that empirical data show consistently more
variation in specificities of all species on the upper trophic level
(hereafter called “strategy diversity”) than predicted by two
contrasting null models. This suggests that organisms with very different
levels of specificity do co- occur in most natural systems. Importantly,
we reveal the existence of a continuum from networks of mostly-specialized
to mostly-generalized species, with the potential for specialist/generalist
co-occurrence being greater at intermediate points. Strategy diversity is
contingent upon network properties, including nestedness (a measure of niche
overlap between species with different specificities), modularity (the fact
that species interact within loosely connected clusters), and connectance (the
proportion of realized links), emphasizing the need to adopt a network-oriented
methodology in the study of biotic interactions at the community level.
