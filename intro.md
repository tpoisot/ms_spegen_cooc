# Introduction

The functional diversity of ecological communities emerges through the
simultaneous occurrence of species with contrasted resource use [@pois11c],
habitat selection [@devi08a], and interactions [@basc03;@wein12]. Both
empirical and theoretical studies have shown how different degrees of niche
partitioning can promote functional diversity [@diaz01; @petc02; @acke07]
and species persistence [@bast09]. However, the co-occurrence of specialist
and generalist species has received considerably less attention. The
majority of studies seeking to understand the conditions for co-occurrence
between populations of specialists and generalists in both biotic (*e.g.*
predator–prey, host–parasite) and abiotic (*e.g.* habitat choice)
interactions have focused on small communities [@wils94; @hoch90; @dem95;
@egas04; @abra06; @ravi09].

Approaches based on model analysis or controlled experiments have two features
impeding their generalization to large communities. First, the number of
interacting organisms is often kept low, to facilitate model analysis or
because of experimental constraints. Studies investigating the co-occurrence
of species with contrasted specificities assume no intermediate situations
between the endpoints of specialism and generalism, whereas natural systems
exhibit a continuum [@fori12; @pois13e]. Second, it is unclear to what extent
results can be scaled up to more realistic communities. Stouffer and colleagues
[@stou09] showed that because adding species and interactions increases the
potential for complex population dynamical feedbacks, complete, realistic
networks tend to exhibit different behaviors than simple modules (*i.e.*
those typically used in models or experiments), begging for an analysis of
co-occurrence in empirical communities.

Network theory offers powerful tools to describe ecological communities
[@prou05] and the distribution of species specificity within them
[@pois12b]. In a species interaction network, each species is a node, and each
interaction is an edge, connecting a pair of nodes. From a network perspective,
one can measure specificity by counting the number of links it has with
other species (its degree), or by measuring aspects of the distribution of
the strengths of such links [@pois12b]. Previous work described the degree
distribution (*i.e.* the distribution of how many interactions each species
establishes and receives) of empirical networks, and revealed a continuum from
highly specialized to generalists species [@otto07]. While much is known about
the factors (*e.g.* biotic [@thra07], abiotic [@ravi09; @fori12], developmental
and physiological [@ferr02]) driving the specialization of single species,
less is known about the spectrum of specificities and niche-overlaps that can
co-occur in large ecological networks, and reasons for different spectra. As
the co-occurrence and interactions between specialized and generalized
species is key to maintaining functional diversity [@devi10a], promoting
community stability [@hass86], and ensuring network persistence [@basc03],
there is a need to investigate the extent and properties of this co-occurrence.

In a previous paper [@pois11c], we argued that the specialisation of
different types of interactions is likely to be shaped by the same set of core
mechanisms, expressed in a different ways or with different intensities. At
the community level, this leads to the expectation that the same relationships
between specificity, the co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, and
other metrics of community structure would occure for different types of
ecological interactions, despite different types of networks, dominated by
positive or negative interactions, occupying different parts of this gradient
[@theb10]. In this study, we use a dataset of interaction networks spanning
three contrasted types of ecological interactions (herbivory, parasitism,
and mutualism), to characterize the extent to which species with different
specificities can co-occur within the same community. In line with our
expectation and past empirical data, we find a continuum from networks
of mostly-specialized to mostly-generalized species, with the potential
for specialist/generalist co-occurrence being greater at intermediate
connectance. One central result is that empirical data show consistently
more variation in specificities of all species on the upper network
level (parasites, herbivores, pollinators; hereafter called “strategy
diversity”) than predicted by two contrasting null models. This suggests
(i) that organisms with very different levels of specificity can co-occur
in most natural systems, and (ii) that ecological or evolutionary mechanisms
are acting to maintain high diversity in the range of specificities.
