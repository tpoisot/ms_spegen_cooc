**Table 2.** Analysis of the results presented in Fig. 2. We used a two-sampled
t-test to determine for which metric networks with either, less, as much,
or more strategy diversity than expected by chance differed. We obsere
that all metrics are different for parasitism networks, but not for other
types of interactions (although our failure to report an effect is most
likely due to the small sample size, as attested by some extremely large
confidence intervals).
