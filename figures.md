# Figures

**Figure 1.** Cartoon depiction of the expected relationships between
connectance and other metrics.

**Figure 2.** Values of average specificity, nestedness, connectance, and
modularity for networks with more (orange) or less (purple) diversity of
strategies than expected by chance. The results within a type of interaction
are all extremely consistent. For this analysis *only*, networks that were
as functionally diverse as expected were removed, as their diversity of
strategies can be explained only by their connectance or degree distribution.

**Figure 3.** Scatterplot of the strategy diversity versus other network
metrics. It is clear that regardless of the interaction type, diversity of
strategies responds in a similar way to other network metrics. Points are
colored as in Figure 2.
