# Figures

**Figure 1.** Cartoon depiction of the expected relationships between
connectance and other metrics.

**Figure 2.** Values of average specificity, nestedness, connectance, and
modularity for networks with more (orange) or less (purple) strategy diversity than expected by chance. The results within a type of interaction
are all highly consistent. For this analysis *only*, networks that were
as functionally diverse as expected (as determined by the Null Models) were removed, as their diversity of
strategies can be explained only by their connectance or degree distribution.

**Figure 3.** Scatterplot of strategy diversity versus other network
metrics. It is clear that regardless of the interaction type, diversity of
strategies responds in a similar way to other network metrics. Points are
colored as in Figure 2.
