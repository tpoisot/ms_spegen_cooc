**Figure 1.** Expected relationships between connectance and other metrics.

**Figure 2.** Values of average specificity, nestedness, connectance,
and modularity for networks with more (orange) or less (purple) strategy
diversity than expected by chance. The results within a type of interaction
are all highly consistent. For this analysis *only*, networks that were as
functionally diverse as expected (as determined by the Null Models) were
removed, since their strategy diversity can be explained solely by either
their connectance or degree distribution. Types of interaction are given
on the x axis, with networks separated as a function of whether they have
more (orange) or less (purple) strategy diversity than expected by chance
(under the assumptions of the second, more restrictive null model).

**Figure 3.** Scatterplot of strategy diversity versus other network
metrics. Regardless of the interaction type, strategy diversity responds
in a similar way to other network metrics. Points are colored as in Figure
2. Triangles are host-parasite systems, squares are plants-herbivores, and
circles are plants-pollinators. Empty triangles are host-parasite networks
that have as many strategy diversity as expected.
