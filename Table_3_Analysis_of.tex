**Table 3.** Analysis of variance partitioning (ANOVA on a linear additive
models) of the effects of connectance, nestedness, average specificity,
and modularity, on the diversity of strategy, and the excess diversity of
strategy (deviation of empirical values from simulated networks).
Preliminary analyses showed no impact of the type of interactions on these
relationships, so this was not included as a covariate.
