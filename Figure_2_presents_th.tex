Figure 2 presents the distributions of specificity, connectance, nestedness,
and modularity in networks that are either more or less functionally
diverse than expected under the assumptions of null model II. Regardless of
the baseline differences between types of network for each of the metrics
considered, higher diversity responded in a consistent way with variation in
the other metrics. Networks with higher average specificity tended to have
lower average strategy diversity, higher connectance, higher nestedness,
and lower modularity (Table 2). Of all these, there are significant
interactions between all of the variables and excess strategy diversity,
with the exception of modularity (Table 3). These four metrics alone account
for 96% of the variance of strategy diversity, and 63% of the variance in the
deviation of this same metric. All metrics but modularity had a significant
impact on the strategy diversity. Interestingly, connectance was the best
predictor of strategy diversity, whereas nestedness was the best predictor
of the how much strategy diversity in the empirical networks deviates from
random expectations. This is easily explained by the fact that null model
testing removes most of the effects of connectance. The type of ecological
interaction was not significant; detecting possible significance would have
probably required a larger sample size for non-parasitic networks.
