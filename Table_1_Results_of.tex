**Table 1.** Results of the null models analyses. For each network metric, and
for each null model, we indicate the proportion of networks that had
significantly larger or smaller values of this metric than expected by chance.
A network has a significantly different value from the prediction when the
empirical values falls outside of the 95% confidence interval for the value as
mesured on the randomized networks [see *e.g.* @flores_statistical_2011].
