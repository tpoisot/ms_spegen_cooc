All types of networks tend to have more strategy diversity and to be composed
of more specialized species than expected by chance. For each empirical
network, we measure whether its structural properties (strategy diversity,
nestedness, modularity) are higher or lower than expected by chance using
the two null models. Our results are reported in Table 1. Both null models
gave consistent results regarding whether the empirical networks represented a
deviation from the random expectations There is also a strong tendency towards
higher than expected nestedness in all types of interactions. Host-parasite
networks are on average less modular than expected, herbivory networks are
more, and there is no clear trend in pollination networks.
